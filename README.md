# Dual Robot Production Line (Arduino Automation Prototype)

Automation prototype simulating a production workflow using two independent robotic arms and a conveyor system programmed in Arduino C++.

Each robotic unit operates autonomously using infrared sensors to detect objects and trigger predefined task sequences, emulating an industrial production line with sensor-based workflow automation.

## System Overview

Arm 1 detects object presence and executes a predefined manipulation sequence.

Arm 2 controls a conveyor belt, detects incoming objects, and performs automated movement cycles.

The system demonstrates sensor-driven automation logic typical of industrial production workflows.
